# School-Assignment-Tracker
# 📝 Homework Tracker

Hello. I'm a 15-year-old high school student, and this is a simple Python app I made to help keep track of homework. I built it using Python during the summer after my freshman year. It lets you add tasks, see them in a list, and mark them as done when you're finished. Since this is the first project I made, I used AI to help guide me in the process of brainstorming, making my code easier to understand, and to make my code into a GUI.

## 🔧 What It Does

- Add homework tasks with a subject, description, and due date
- See all tasks in a list
- Click to mark a task as done (and it disappears)

## 🎯 Why I Made This

I wanted to learn more about coding and make something actually useful. I also wanted to make something useful that can actually help in my school life. This is also my first project and I want to start creating more projects after this.
